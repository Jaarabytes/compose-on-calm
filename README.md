# Cocalm

Edit audio files in your browser. Zero server code needed.

**Tips**: (I will fix these soon)
- Ignore the `svelte` branch
- Ignore the `failed production deployment`

## Contributions

Keep them to yourself.

## TL;DR

This project was to be wide, however it was sadly [already implemented](https://github.com/yacineMTB/talk)
